# public-transport-ridership-forecast

This project analyzes and forecasts public transport ridership using time series techniques. The goal is to uncover usage patterns, clean irregularities in daily data, and build accurate predictive models to support data-driven decision-making for urban mobility.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Data Processing:** Cleaned and pre-processed public transport ridership data using `Pandas`.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Used `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to visualize seasonal and mode-wise ridership trends.
- **Modeling:**
  - Applied time series techniques (e.g., SARIMAX from `Statsmodels`)
  - Built regression-based forecasts using `Scikit-learn`.
- **Forecasting:** Developed models to predict future ridership with improved accuracy.

## 📊 Key Features

- Identified seasonal trends and transport mode fluctuations
- Handled irregularities and outliers in time series data
- Compared multiple models for forecasting performance
